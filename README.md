## Finable: A Banking API That Packs a Punch!
   
Hey there! Iâ€™m Chukwuka, and Finable is my stellar banking API built for the Learnable 24 Backend Standardisation Test. Crafted with Node.js, TypeScript, Express, and MongoDB, this is a secure, scalable powerhouse for core banking operations, blending clean code with unrelenting reliability.
## Overview
Finable is more than an APIâ€”itâ€™s my hustle and craft, designed to make banking seamless and secure. From creating accounts with virtual cards to decrypting sensitive data, this project tackles real-world challenges with finesse.
## Features

Effortless Account Creation:The POST /api/accounts endpoint spins up accounts with auto-generated virtual cards. Sensitive data like phone numbers, dates of birth, and card details? Secured with Crypto AES encryption for top-tier protection.

Transparent Account Listing:Hit GET /api/accounts to fetch all accounts and their linked virtual cards, served with both encrypted and decrypted data for ultimate transparency.

Secure Data Decryption:The POST /api/decrypt endpoint unlocks sensitive fields like card numbers safely, ensuring only authorized access.

## The Grind
Building finable was like cooking the perfect jollof riceâ€”every ingredient had to pop. I wrestled with CVV generation bugs, streamlined encryption, and optimized ID generation with crypto. Hours of debugging, logging, and redeploying later, this API is a vibe: secure, efficient, and ready to impress.
